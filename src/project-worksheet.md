# Project Overview


## Project Description
My project will be an application that lists hockey statistics for teams and players in the NHL. As a longtime fan of the sport, I am excited to create a site that will display additional hockey stats that most do not have. I will be pulling data from the NHL api directly, which is free for anyone to use.

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.<br/>

| Component | Description |
| :---: | :---: |  
| Main | This is the React Router |
| Header | This will render the nav |
| Footer | This will render the footer |
| Teams | This will be the component that renders all teams and rosters |
| Team | This will be the component that renders a specific team|
| Team Details | This will be the component that renders a specific team and roster |
| Players | This will render all players in NHL |
| Player | This will render individual player in NHL |
| Player Details | This will render individual player statistics |



<br/>
Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Configuring API | High | 3hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Creating Component Structure/Routes | High | 3hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Configuring Header Component | High | 1.5hrs| N/A | N/A |
| Configuring Home Component | High | 1.5hrs| N/A | N/A |

| Total | H | 28hrs| N/A | N/A |

## Code Snippet
